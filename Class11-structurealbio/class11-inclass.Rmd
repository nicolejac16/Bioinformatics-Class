```{r}

pbd.data <- read.csv("DataExportSummary.csv")
pbd.data
```

```{r}
# Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
xray.em <- ((sum(pbd.data$X.ray) + sum(pbd.data$EM)) / (sum(pbd.data$Total)) * 100)
xray.em


```

```{r}
# Q2: What percent of structures in the PDB are protein?
struc.prot <- ((pbd.data[1,8])) / (sum(pbd.data$Total)) * 100
struc.prot
```

Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

23409

Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The resolution of the structure is only 1.9 angstroms which makes the H atoms impossible to visualize

Q5: There is a conserved water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have (see note below)?

OH308:0

# Using bio3d in R for structural analysis

```{r}
library(bio3d)

```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hel")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

# Now let's look at protein dynamics (flexiblity). We will use nma function for this. Does a normal model analysis

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```

# Make a little movie (trajectory) for viewing in VMD.

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="nma.pdb")
```


Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?
  
  198
  
Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

  HOH
  
Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

  2
  

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```


```{r}

Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 
 
  msa

Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?

 bio3d-view 
  
Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?

  TRUE

# Comparative strucutre analyiss
  Start by getting a sequence of interest
  
```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```


Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 
  
  214
  
```{r}
# Preforming a blast search here using a file from the structural database pdb. 
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)

```



```{r}
# Plot blast results
hits <- plot(blast)
```

```{r}
# Will give us the top blast hits by giving the ID of the top matching pdb results
(hits$pdb.id)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','4X8M_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','4X8H_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','4NP6_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```


```{r}
# here we download all the similar structural hits in the pdb and store them as a viarable files on our computer
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

We now want to align all these structures. Will be using a function called pdbaln

```{r}

pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE)

```

```{r}
pdbs
```


```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```

Here we will do a PCA on the xyz cordinates data of all the structures that aligned with our search

```{r}
# Do a PCA!
pctest <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pctest)
```

Let's visualize the movements of the structures that are captured by PC1

```{r}
mktrj(pctest, pc=1, file="pca.pdb")
```


![](pca.png)

Let's save our important results

```{r}
#save(blast, hits, pctest, file="myresults.RData")

#load("myresults.RData")
```



```{r}
# NMA of all structures
modes <- nma(pdbs)
```




```{r}
plot(modes, pdbs)
```
